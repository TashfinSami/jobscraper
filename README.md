## JobScraper
JobScraper is flutter app for searching and applying for jobs. It uses Serp API so it can provide limited Google API for free.

I uploaded this project just to show what I managed to do from 2 month of learning Dart and Flutter. Since this was my first experience in developing mobile applications, the written code turned out to be not very optimized. But my goal was to make a working application - which I successfully did. 

Now I want to redesign and improve this application using more appropriate tools. (UDP: I didn't lol).

You can see the project [demo](https://youtu.be/Ae0pupZ0YzA).
